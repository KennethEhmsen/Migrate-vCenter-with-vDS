Known Issues:

1.     Duplicate folder names that exist under the same vCenter - ie, the same folder name existing say in different datacenters under the same VC.

Misc:

- This part renames the old cluster.  I have it currently commented out.  Customize and uncomment to use:
 
Set-Cluster -Cluster $Cluster -Name $Cluster" - Migrated to https://newvcenter.company.com/" -Confirm:$false
 
- This part emails out reporting on migration activities.  I have it currently commented out.  Customize and uncomment to use:
 
$CSVhosts = Import-Csv .\$SourcevCenter\$Cluster\VMHost.csv | out-string
Send-MailMessage -To "SOMEONE <SOMEONE@SOMEWHERE.com>", "SOMEONE2 <SOMEONE2@SOMEWHERE.com>" `
-From "ME <ME@SOMEWHERE.com>" -subject "Notice - ESXi Servers Migrated" `
-smtp smtp.server.com -body "$CSVhosts Source vCenter $SourcevCenter
Destination vCenter $DestinationvCenter" | out-null
